From the dojoassignments/python/django folder
django-admin startproject project_name

cd project_name

mkdir apps
cd apps

make an __init__.py in the apps folder

python ../manage.py startapp app_name
cd..

in python/django/project_name find settings.py
in INSTALLED_APPS add a line with apps.app_name

in python/django/project_name find urls.py
after 'from django.conf.urls import url' add ', include'
in urlpatterns add a line with url(r'^', include('apps.app_name.urls'))

in python/django/project_name/apps/app_name create urls.py. so far i've used:

from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index)
]

in python/django/project_name/apps/app_name find views.py;

add 'HttpResponse' and 'redirect' to import from django.shortcuts
define the index function based on your needs. Here is an example with an HttpResponse

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse('hello')

in python/django/project_name/apps/app_name create /templates/app_name directory and store app related templates(.html) there.
